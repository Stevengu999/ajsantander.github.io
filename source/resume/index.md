Hello! I'm a senior, front-end software developer looking for projects that involve building web applications for blockchain related projects. For years, I've specialized in building 3D rendering and physics engines. In particular, I built libraries for people to use in their games, as well as acted as a specialist consultant for individual clients. As my interest for gaming waned and my focus shifted into general purpose applications, I spent a few years developing all kinds of iOS applications as an Objective-C/Swift developer. I've worked on dozens of projects in all the formats I can think of: as a freelance developer, as a permanent employee with large and/or small teams, building entire apps on my own, directing teams, collaborating with open source communities, etc. --I am very familiar with agile development. I believe that the future is in the web, and in decentralization, so I am making a 3rd change in my carreer to become a full stack node developer.
