Hello! I'm a front end software developer, so far specialized in advanced graphics, animation and interactivity. Building games, physics simulations and 3D engines has taught me how to code and solve problems that arise in most areas of programming. These often involve severe performance and scalability challenges in which a robust architecture and a trained divide-and-conquer mindset are a requirement. I've explored the mobile app industry as an iOS developer for a while, and I am now trying to explore the world of rapid web development as a full stack javascript/node developer. Ideally, I'd like to participate in projects related to the blockchain technology and the more 'political' aspect of code that seems to be thriving nowadays. I have 10+ years of professional experience with code, I'm very familiar with agile development, with working with small and large teams, as well as with doing open source collaboration. Beyond the areas that I've explored, and the languages I've learnt, or even the developing environments I've familiarized myself with, I'd say that the most important ability in my inventory is an obsessive determination for problem solving.
