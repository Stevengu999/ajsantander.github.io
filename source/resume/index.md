Hello! I'm a senior software developer with a lot of experience in games and graphics, currently learning  web and crypto. I've done quite a bit of iOS work too. My educational background is physics, mathematics and music, so I'm used to high degrees of abstraction and the divide-and-conquer philosophy for problem solving. Building 3D engines and games has taught me how to produce code that can be extended nicely, since these topics often involve severe performance and scalability challenges. I have years of experience working with teams on site or remotely, as well as contributing to open source projects. I believe that the world can be made a better place with code, that there is true power in it. I'm looking for projects that have some of that.
